      "A room this size reflected the splendour of the familyâ€™s lifestyle: at Highclere before World War I, this required a domestic staff that included 25 maids, 14 footmen and three chefs.\n",

      "Sometimes serves as the Earl of Granthamâ€™s private den.\n",

      "This was menial work, but there was no shame in it. In 1912, the year in which Downtonâ€™s first series was set, 1.3â€‰million people worked in domestic service, compared to 1.2â€‰million on the land and 970,000 in the mines.\n",

      "A mother who was acquitted after shooting her ex-husband dead 20 years ago is now facing charges for shooting her adult son and paralyzing him - with the same gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linda Cooney, 64, was cleared in the death of James Cooney on February 7, 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle after she claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in June 2011, she shot her son Kevin, 32, in the neck in Las Vegas with the same .357 Magnum after an argument about his girlfriend, whom Linda Cooney had been accused of stalking.\n",

      "Again, Cooney, a former legal secretary, claimed she shot out of self defense after her 6ft 9 inch son, a bouncer at a local club, had attacked her during the argument.\n",

      "Attorneys are now discussing whether \n",

      " Kevin Cooney's testimony when he was just 11 years old had been key to \n",

      "the Sun Sentinel.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had initially told police that his father's hands were empty when he saw him killed on the floor, but in the 1993 trial in Palm Beach, Florida he said that his father may have been holding something.\n",

      "Las Vegas prosecutors are concerned the son could again testify positively for his mother, who has been speaking to him via his brother's cell phone from hospital, authorities say.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument that led to the shooting came after years of tension over Kevin Cooney's girlfriend, Karina Taylor, whom he met in 2009 but did not tell his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taylor told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting Linda Cooney because she was 'crazy and it would cause nothing but problems'.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when Cooney did finally meet Taylor, she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a series of texts calling her a 'stripper,' 'w****,' 'prostitute' and 'skank'.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also reached told a non-profit cancer organization where Taylor volunteered and said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs, prosecutors said.\n",

      "Home: They argued over Kevin's girlfriend, whom Linda had allegedly called a 'skank' and 'w****'\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors added that Taylor was genuinely fearful of Cooney, and this led to the argument on June 28, 2011.\n",

      "Police received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from Cooney and one from Kevin's younger brother, Chris, a Las Vegas police officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the calls came after a 15-minute call between Cooney and Chris. By this point, Kevin had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not feel his legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Chris called police, he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him, and Linda Cooney called police to say her son had been shot in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooney refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son, although at one point said: 'The gun, it's my fault, it's my fault.'\n",
      "\n",
      "When police arrived, Kevin was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him, he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident.\n",

      "In November 2011, Chris visited his brother at the hospital and allowed his mother to talk to his brother on his cell phone - and Kevin has since been less cooperative with prosecutors.\n",

       "\"There are few obvious similarities between superstar Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard and Hull's Scottish keeper Allan McGregor but both share the honour of being penalty perfectionists.\\n\\nHazard is understandably confident from the spot, having scored 17 goals from 17 attempts in domestic competition for Chelsea and his previous club Lille - but David Meyler says McGregor is the man to stop the Belgian should he get the chance on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.\\n\\nThe former Rangers keeper has been impenetrable from 12 yards since his move to Hull, saving three penalties starting with Frank Lampard's effort in last season's opener against Chelsea.\\n\\nHull goalkeeper Allan McGregor starred in their 0-0 draw with West Brom after saving a penalty\\n\\nGraham Dorrans couldn't beat McGregor, who has now saved all three Premier League penalties he's faced\\n\\nDorrans reacts after McGregor was up to the task to save a draw for Steve Bruce's 18th-placed side\\n\\nSince then he's saved a penalty from QPR's Charlie Austin and last week he was hailed Hull's hero as his stop from West Brom's Graham Dorrans helped Steve Bruce's side salvage a scoreless draw.\\n\\nWhile Hazard's record from the dot is impressive, the best in any of Europe's top five leagues, he's faltered in Europe and McGregor's team-mate David Meyler says McGregor could have his number.\\n\\n'He's a fantastic keeper,' Meyler told The Sun's Graeme Bryce of McGregor, who joined Hull from Besiktas.\\xa0\\n\\nEden Hazard is deadly from 12 yards, having scored 17 from 17 attempts in domestic competitions\\xa0\\n\\nHazard has been flawless in leagues for Lille and Chelsea, but is yet to take a penalty against Hull's McGregor\\n\\nDavid Meyler says his keeper has been an inspiration since his move last season from Besiktas\\n\\nIt was was not so long ago that McGregor was the subject of Republic of Ireland international Meyler's abuse from the Celtic stands while he was in goal for Rangers.\\n\\nMeyler's no doubt happy to have the 32-year-old on his side after he famously saved Georgios Samaras's penalty late in the season in 2011 in an undoubted turning point in that year's Scottish title that went the way of Rangers. \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\n'He's been inspirational since day one ... He works really hard on penalties with our other goalies Steve Harper and Eldin Jakupovic, as well as Gary Walsh our goalkeeping coach.\\n\\n'They all talk through penalties and go through the information about whatever side we're playing. Allan really studies up on all that stuff and he's clearly doing it well, as the stats prove.'\\xa0\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nChelsea's Eden Hazard hasn't missed in his 17 Premier League penalties\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHull keeper Allan McGregor has saved three from three spot-kicks\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nDavid Meyler said McGregor has been an inspiration since day one\\xa0\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nLeaders Chelsea host 18th-placed Hull on Saturday at Stamford Bridge\\xa0\\xa0\""
