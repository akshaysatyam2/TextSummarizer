Justine\\xa0 Davidge, representing the SFO,\\n told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Levene had been subject to a \\nbankruptcy order since October 2009 and there were ongoing \\ninvestigations into his assets.\\n\\nJailed: Levene, nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic (pictured left on the trading floor in 1990, and right with wife Tracy), was jailed for 13 years in November last year\\n\\nShe added that anything seized would \\nbe dealt with by bankruptcy officials.\\n\\n‘In respect of the realisable \\namount, we suggest the court make a nominal order of £1 to be paid in \\nseven days,’ she said. ‘It may be in the future, Mr Levene could come \\ninto further realisable assets.’\\n\\nLevene admitted ripping off a series \\nof high-fliers, including Sir Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag, the\\n founders of the Stagecoach bus and rail group; Richard Caring, owner of\\n The Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in the West End; and Russell \\nBartlett, director of the R3 Investment Group and former owner of Hull \\nCity Football Club. Nicknamed Beano because of his childhood love of the\\n comic book, Levene was a successful City worker with an estimated \\nwealth of £15million to £20million in 2005.\\n\\nHigh-flyer: Levene conned some of Britain's most successful businessmen while owning this £2million eight-bedroom property in Barnet, North London\\n\\nLavish lifestyle: Levene ran a multi-million pound illegal 'Ponzi' fraud scheme which he used to finance private jets (file picture), super yachts, a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot and on hosting £10,000-a-day pheasant shoots\\n\\nBut he was addicted to gambling, spending fortunes on spread betting, and had an insatiable taste\\xa0 for luxury.\\n\\nLevene, a former deputy chairman of \\nLeyton Orient Football Club, admitted one count of false accounting, one\\n of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and 12 of fraud.\\n\\nHe would take from Peter to pay Paul \\nand move the funds between accounts in the financial havens of Jersey, \\nSwitzerland and Israel.\\n\\nSeeing stars: The fraudster spent £588,000 on his second son's Bar Mitzvah celebration, which featured a performance by girl band The Saturdays (file picture)\\n\\nSpent big: His fraud scheme meant he could pay for a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot (file picture) but with interest and potential profits considered, clients are believed to have lost out by £101.6million\\n\\nVictim: Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag (pictured) lost £10million\\n\\nWith his network of contacts and \\nstrong reputation, he won people’s faith with seemingly concrete \\ninvestment deals from which he would take a commission or fee.\\n\\nThe married father of three took \\nmillions of investors’ funds, promising to invest the money in lucrative\\n rights-issue releases from\\xa0 companies such as HSBC, Lloyds TSB and \\nmining firms Xstrata and Rio Tinto.\\n\\nBut he dug an ever-deepening financial\\n hole for himself, having to fob off clients and make excuses about why \\nhe could not pay them.\\n\\nLiving the high life, he had a chauffeur-driven Bentley and went on several holidays a year, each lasting several weeks.\\n\\nInvestigators found evidence of round-the-world trips, yacht hire and top hotel stays in Australia, South Africa and Israel.\\n\\nThe fraudster had a fleet of luxury \\ncars and spent £588,000 on his second son’s Bar Mitzvah celebration, \\nwhich featured a performance by girlband The Saturdays. Levene’s main \\nhouse was a £2million eight-bedroom property in\\xa0 Barnet, North London.\\n\\nHis gambling was huge, with investigators finding evidence of him blowing £720,000 on a cricket match bet in 2007.\\n\\nHaving been told about the seizure of \\nLevene’s assets, Judge Martin Beddow said: ‘As there is nothing \\navailable, I direct the payable amount will be the nominal amount of £1 \\nto be paid in seven days.’\\n\\nLevene did not appear in court for the hearing.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nNicholas Levene must pay the nominal sum because he is bankrupt\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHe used the
