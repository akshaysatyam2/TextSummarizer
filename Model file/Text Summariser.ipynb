      "â€˜This is the first time that scientists have identified that early modern humans at the cusp of dispersal out of Africa were grouped in separate, isolated and local populations,â€™ Dr Eleanor Scerri, visiting scholar at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study said.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜Stone tools are the only form of preserved material culture for most of human history. In Africa, owing to the hot climate, ancient DNA has not yet been found.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜These stone tools reveal how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the Sahara just before they left North Africa. While different populations were relatively isolated, we were interested to find that when connected by rivers, they share similarities in their tool-making suggesting some interaction with one another.â€™\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers used a variety of tests in order to rule that tools from different areas were culturally distinct simply because of differences in raw materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tools, discovered in the region between sub-Saharan Africa and Eurasia -  including the desert (marked on the map) - were made in different ways, reflecting a diversity of cultural traditions\n",
      "\n",
      "The study looking at different types of tools, has for the first time shown how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the Sahara before forming small populations by the rivers\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Scerri said: â€˜Not much is known about the structure of early modern human populations in Africa, particularly at the time of their earliest dispersals into Eurasia.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜Our picture of modern human demography around 100,000 years ago is that there were a number of populations, varying in size and degree of genetic contact, distributed over a wide geographical area.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜This model of our population history supports other theories recently put forward that modern humans may have first successfully left Africa earlier than 60,000-50,000 years ago, which had been the common view among scholars.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜Our work provides important new evidence that sheds light on both the timing of early modern human dispersals out of Africa and the character of our interaction with other human species, such as Neanderthals.â€™\n",

      "I understand that Mr Shirley has not actually sold the field yet, but instead granted Charles Church Homes a legally binding 'option' to buy it, for several million pounds, provided planning permission is granted. But details of the deal are hard to ascertain.\n",

      "\n",
      "Britain's five-million-plus asthmatics are normally issued with two types of inhaler. The brown model contains a low dose of steroids and is prescribed to stop attacks from starting and it is thought that it works best if taken regularly to build up resistance in the lungs, with many people using it daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second type, which is often blue, is filled with a drug that rapidly opens up the airways during an asthma attack.\n",

      "Joshua was taking puffs from his inhaler but they didn't make any difference. He became unconscious and his mum dialled 999 and tried to resuscitate him while waiting for the ambulance.He was rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital but was pronounced dead at 8.30pm.\n",

He works really hard on penalties with our other goalies Steve Harper and Eldin Jakupovic, as well as Gary Walsh our goalkeeping coach.\\n\\n'They all talk through penalties and go through the information about whatever side we're playing. Allan really studies up on all that stuff and he's clearly doing it well, as the stats prove.'\\xa0\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nChelsea's Eden Hazard hasn't missed in his 17 Premier League penalties\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nHull keeper Allan McGregor has saved three from three spot-kicks\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nDavid Meyler said McGregor has been an inspiration since day one\\xa0\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nLeaders Chelsea host 18th-placed Hull on Saturday at Stamford Bridge\\xa0\\xa0\""
